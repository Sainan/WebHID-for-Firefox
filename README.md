# WebHID for Firefox

A WebExtension & server that work together to provide WebHID APIs on Firefox. 

## Things to note about the server

- The server is designed to run in the background, so double-clicking it will seemingly not have any effect, but you can see it's running in task manager.
- To have the server run when you start your PC, you can put the EXE in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Start-up`.

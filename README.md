# WebHID for Firefox

A WebExtension & server that work together to provide WebHID APIs on Firefox. 

## Installation

1. [Get the extension on addons.mozilla.org.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/webhid-for-firefox/)
2. Download the WebHID-for-Firefox-Server.exe from [the latest release](https://github.com/Sainan/WebHID-for-Firefox/releases).
3. Optionally, if you want the server to start with your PC, move the executable to the `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Start-up` folder.
4. Double-click the executable to start the server.
	- Note that the server is designed to run in the background, so it will not do anything noticable once started. If you want to be sure it's running, you can check the task manager.
